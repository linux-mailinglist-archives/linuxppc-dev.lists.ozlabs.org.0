It's not clear exactly what you're suggesting, but it sounds like you're
complaining about this:

    config CRC32_ARCH
            bool
            depends on CRC32 && CRC_OPTIMIZATIONS
            default y if ARM && KERNEL_MODE_NEON
            default y if ARM64
            default y if LOONGARCH
            default y if MIPS && CPU_MIPSR6
            default y if PPC64 && ALTIVEC
            default y if RISCV && RISCV_ISA_ZBC
            default y if S390
            default y if SPARC64
            default y if X86

We could instead make each arch be responsible for selecting this from
lib/crc/$(SRCARCH)/Kconfig, which lib/crc/Kconfig would then have to include.
But I don't think the small bit of additional per-arch separation would be worth
the extra complexity here.  Something similar applies to lib/crc/Makefile too.

This patchset strikes a balance where the vast majority of the arch-specific CRC
code is isolated in lib/crc/$(SRCARCH), and the exceptions are just
lib/crc/Makefile and lib/crc/Kconfig.  I think these exceptions make sense,
given that we're building a single module per CRC variant.  We'd have to go
through some hoops to isolate the arch-specific Kconfig and Makefile snippets
into per-arch files, which don't seem worth it here IMO.

> It would also allow for alternatives if that ever becomes a thing and

If you mean one arch with multiple alternative implementations of a particular
CRC variant, that already exists for many of the architectures.  They just build
in as many as can be, and the best one is chosen at boot or module load time.

But that's existing behavior, unchanged by this patchset.

They all use instructions specific to the corresponding arch, so I don't think
any of them would be compatible with COMPILE_TEST.
