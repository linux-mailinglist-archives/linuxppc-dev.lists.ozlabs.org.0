My main concern is that these cross-subsystem drivers are a pain to
maintain. So there have to be good reasons to do this.

Also it is kind of weird to have to use the V4L2 API in userspace to
deal with a specific audio conversion. Quite unexpected.

But in the end, that's a decision I can't make.

So I wait for that feedback. Note that if the decision is made that this
can use V4L2, then there is quite a lot more that needs to be done:
documentation, new compliance tests, etc. It's adding a new API, and that
comes with additional work...

Regards,
