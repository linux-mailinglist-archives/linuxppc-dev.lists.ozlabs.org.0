Thanks for adding us to this discussion. I think somehow my last post 
got html content and didn't make to mailing list, so am posting it 
again. Sorry to those who are receiving it twice.

If I have understood the discussion right, the key idea discussed here 
is to unify multiple different interfaces(this one, and [1]) exposing 
secrets for confidential computing usecase via securityfs.

And the suggestion is to see if the proposed pseries interface [2] can 
unify with the coco interface.

At high level, pseries interface is reading/writing/adding/deleting 
variables using the sysfs interface, but the underlying semantics and 
actual usecases are quite different.

The variables exposed via pseries proposed interface are:

* Variables owned by firmware as read-only.
* Variables owned by bootloader as read-only.
* Variables owned by OS and get updated as signed updates. These support 
both read/write.
* Variables owned by OS and get directly updated(unsigned) eg config 
information or some boot variables. These support both read/write.

It can be extended to support variables which contain secrets like 
symmetric keys, are owned by OS and stored in platform keystore.

Naming convention wise also, there are differences like pseries 
variables do not use GUIDs.

The initial patchset discusses secure boot usecase, but it would be 
extended for other usecases as well.

First, I feel the purpose itself is different here. If we still 
continue, I fear if we will get into similar situation as Matthew 
mentioned in context of efivars -

"the patches to add support for
manipulating the Power secure boot keys originally attempted to make it
look like efivars, but the underlying firmware semantics are
sufficiently different that even exposing the same kernel interface
wouldn't be a sufficient abstraction and userland would still need to
behave differently. Exposing an interface that looks consistent but
isn't is arguably worse for userland than exposing explicitly distinct
interfaces."

With that, I believe the scope of pseries interface is different and 
much broader than being discussed here. So, I wonder if it would be 
better to still keep pseries interface separate from this and have its 
own platform specific interface.

I would be happy to hear the ideas.
