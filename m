yes, very good! It's clearly stated in all three documentations
that Target replaces Slave and Controller replaces Master (i3c is
at the 1.1.1 version).

Also because some drivers have been written based on previous
specifications where master/slave was used.

I think it's a good plan, I'll try to support you with it.

Thank you, Wolfram!
