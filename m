Before addressing that, I'd like to share some of the current OpenPOWER
secure boot design.
Different from UEFI, secure boot in OpenPOWER systems have two distinct
domains. Each one has its own key hierarchy and signing and signature
verification mechanisms.

In the firmware secure boot domain (work already upstream):
 - Every image loaded up to skiroot is wrapped in a secure boot container.
Skiroot is a Linux zimage with petitboot (kexec bootloader) embedded in the
initramfs.
 - Within the secure boot container, the payload image is protected by a
chain of signatures anchored in the root ECDSA keys, also known as hardware
keys.
 - All public keys required to verify the container are stored in the
container itself, but a hash of the trusted public hardware keys is stored
in a protected SEEPROM region outside of the container. Firmware uses it to
check if the container is anchored in the trusted hardware keys. If not,
the container payload is not executed and the boot is aborted.
 - The hash of the hardware keys is set by the firmware supplier, for
instance, the platform manufacturer.

In OS secure boot domain (work in progress):
- The skiroot container is verified as part of firmware secure boot.
- Skiroot uses UEFI-like secure variables (PK, KEK and db) to verify OS
kernels. Only X.509 certificates will be supported for these secure variables.
- OS kernels are signed using the Linux kernel sign-file tool, as if they
were kernel modules.
- In the skiroot kernel, if secure boot is enabled, the db certificates
will be loaded into the platform keyring and IMA-appraisal will verify the
kexec image against the platform keyring.
- The PK is set by whoever controls the platform, for instance, the
manufacturer or the end customer.

How about dbx and dbt?

The db keys will be used to verify only OS kernels via kexecs initiated by
petitboot. So we only need the dbx to revoke kernel images, either via
certs or hashes. Currently, the kernel loads certs and hashes from the dbx
to the system blacklist keyring. The revoked certs are checked during pkcs7
signature verification and loading of keys. However, there doesn't appear
to be any verification against blacklisted hashes. Should kernel images be
revoked only by keys and not hashes? We tried to find published revoked
kernel lists but couldn't find any. How is kernel image revocation handled
in practice?

Also, we didn't see the shim or kernel loading anything from dbt.

In general, how do you think the kernel ought to support blacklists?

In (2) and (3) the extensions are added to the update queue, which is
processed only in (5) by firmware. So, in (4) you should see the db content
without the extensions.
In (5), firmware (skiboot) will process the update queue. The extensions
will be applied only if *all* of them are valid and pass signature
verification. Only in this case should you be able to see the extensions in
(6). If any of the extensions fail, firmware will discard all of them,
clear the queue, and do the proper logging.

Because that seems to add more complexity than having three levels (PK, KEK
and db).

Typically, the intermediate level organisations (or KEK) are used to
authorize new additions to db. However, if we also have them in the db, who
would authorize the new additions to db. If that would be the intermediate
level organisation entries now in the db, it seems we would need to
implement a mechanism to determine which entries are for authorizing new
additions and which are for kernel signature verification. If that would be
the PK, we'd be burdening the PK owner to sign every new db addition if the
platform is owned by a company that has intermediate level organizations.

I'm not sure I understand your question.  We would be using dbx to prevent
kernels from being loaded. How is that related to having three levels in
the key hierarchy (PK, KEK and db)?

Thanks,
Claudio
