There is no code in the kernel is poisoning/unpoisoning
redzones/variables on stack. It's because it's always done by the compiler, it inserts
some code in prologue/epilogue of every function.
So compiler needs to know the shadow offset which will be used to poison/unpoison
stack frames.

There is no such kind of limitation on globals instrumentation. The only reason globals
instrumentation depends on -fasan-shadow-offset is because there was some bug related to
globals in old gcc version which didn't support -fasan-shadow-offset.


If you want stack instrumentation with not standard mem-to-shadow mapping, the options are:
1. Patch compiler to make it possible the poisoning/unpoisonig of stack frames via function calls.
2. Use out-line instrumentation and do whatever mem-to-shadow mapping you want, but keep all kernel
stacks in some special place for which standard mem-to-shadow mapping (addr >>3 +offset)
works.
