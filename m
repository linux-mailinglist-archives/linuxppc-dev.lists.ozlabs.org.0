I have also realized that the rest of the early created caches is initialized
with albeit non-zero, but in fact deterministically same same sequence values.

Looks so, thanks for explanation. So there's simply no entropy and the kmalloc-X
caches have deterministic s->random. Zeroes are just more obvious and may fail
e.g. to prevent detection for random corruptions (so we should still fix
those?), while for an attacker anything predictable is bad, and I don't know
what to do about it. If we were to e.g. reseed the early created kmalloc caches
later where crng is fully inited, we would have to basically "stop the world"
and rewrite existing freelists.
