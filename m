yes that is correct. We ideally want to deny MAP_SYNC only w.r.t 
POWER10. But on a virtualized platform there is no easy way to detect 
that. We could ideally hook this into the nvdimm driver where we look at 
the new compat string ibm,persistent-memory-v2 and then disable MAP_SYNC
if we find a device with the specific value.

BTW with the recent changes I posted for the nvdimm driver, older kernel 
won't initialize persistent memory device on newer hardware. Newer 
hardware will present the device to OS with a different device tree 
compat string.

My expectation  w.r.t this patch was, Distro would want to  mark
CONFIG_ARCH_MAP_SYNC_DISABLE=n based on the different application 
certification.  Otherwise application will have to end up calling the 
prctl(MMF_DISABLE_MAP_SYNC, 0) any way. If that is the case, should this
be dependent on P10?

With that I am wondering should we even have this patch? Can we expect 
userspace get updated to use new instruction?.

With ppc64 we never had a real persistent memory device available for 
end user to try. The available persistent memory stack was using vPMEM 
which was presented as a volatile memory region for which there is no 
need to use any of the flush instructions. We could safely assume that 
as we get applications certified/verified for working with pmem device 
on ppc64, they would all be using the new instructions?
