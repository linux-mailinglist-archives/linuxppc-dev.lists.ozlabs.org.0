As I said in a previous reply, I'm fine with reverting this commit if it
breaks existing configs. It's only that Andrew had already queued it in
his tree but we have time until the final 6.4 kernel is released.

That said, would you mind sending a patch reverting it (if removing
EXPERT, I'd like to keep the ranges)? ;)

Thanks.
