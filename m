I think it was also to do with aliasing, but I don't recall all of the
details.

I think it only matters for Armv7 CPUs, but yes, we should probably be
setting L_PTE_XN for both of these memory types.

That would be great, thanks.

All sounds good to me, although I suppose 32-bit Arm platforms without
CONFIG_ARM_DMA_MEM_BUFFERABLE may run into issues if DMA_ATTR_WRITE_COMBINE
disappears. Only one way to find out...
