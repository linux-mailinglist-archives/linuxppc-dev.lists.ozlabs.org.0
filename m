The original sysv PowerPC supplement
http://refspecs.linux-foundation.org/elf/elfspec_ppc.pdf
supports LE as well, and most powerpcle ports use that.  But, the
big-endian Linux ABI differs in quite a few places, and it of course
makes a lot better sense if powerpcle-linux follows that.

What patches did you need?  I regularly build >30 cross compilers (on
both BE and LE hosts; I haven't used 32-bit hosts for a long time, but
in the past those worked fine as well).  I also cross-built
powerpcle-linux-gcc quite a few times (from powerpc64le, from powerpc64,
from various x86).

Heh :-)

Almost no project that used 32-bit PowerPC in LE mode has sent patches
to the upstreams.

The ABI says long longs are passed in the same order in registers as it
would be in memory; so the high part and the low part are swapped between
BE and LE.  Which registers make up a pair is exactly the same between
the two.  (You can verify this with an existing powerpcle-* compiler, too;
I did, and we implement it correctly as far as I can see).

But you should :-)

A huge factor in having good GCC support for powerpcle-linux (or anything
else) is someone needs to regularly test it, and share test results with
us (via gcc-testresults@).  Hint hint hint :-)

That way we know it is in good shape, know when we are regressing it,
know there is interest in it.
