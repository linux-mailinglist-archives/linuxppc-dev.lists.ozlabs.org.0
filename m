yes and it considers that there are the same number of CPUs per group

what you want to test here is that moving 1 task from busiest to local group
would help and balance the ratio of tasks per cpu

(busiest->sum_nr_running - 1) / busiest->group_weight > (local->sum_nr_running + 1) / local->group_weight

which can be develop into

busiest->sum_nr_running * local->group_weight >= local->sum_nr_running * busiest->group_weight + busiest->group_weight + local->group_weight

and you also have to change how we calculate the imbalance which just provide the half of the diff of nr_running

by something like

(busiest->sum_nr_running * local->group_weight) - (local->sum_nr_running * busiest->group_weight) / (busiest->group_weight + local->group_weight)

there is the same behavior and assumption here too

unused capacity doesn't give the instantaneous state so a group can be idle but without
unused capacity
