That takes hugepage size, which is mostly derived out of vma. Hence vma need to be a hugetlb vma. Some of the functions also depend on hstate. Also we should use set_huge_pte_at() when setting up hugetlb pte entries. I was tempted to remove that test completely marking it broken. But avoided that by marking it broken on only PPC64.

There is nothing ppc64 specific here. It is just that we have 
CONFIG_DEBUG_VM based checks for different possibly wrong usages of 
these functions. This was done because we have different page sizes, two 
different translations to support and we want to avoid any wrong usage. 
IMHO expecting hugetlb page table helpers to work with a non hugetlb VMA 
and  without holding hugeTLB pte lock is a clear violation of hugetlb 
interface.
