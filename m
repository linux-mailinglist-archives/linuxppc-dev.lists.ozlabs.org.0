Hi,

I don't think that's quite true, becuase arm64's procedure call standard
(AAPCS64) doesn't give us enough information to determine this without
additional metadata from the compiler, which we simply don't have today.

Since there's a lot of confusion in this area, I've made a bit of an info dump
below, before review on the patch itself, but TBH I'm struggling to see that
this is all that useful.

On arm64, we use a calling convention called AAPCS64, (in full: "Procedure Call
Standard for the ArmÂ® 64-bit Architecture (AArch64)"). That's maintained at:

  https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa

... with the latest release (as of today) at:

  https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/blob/60a8eb8c55e999d74dac5e368fc9d7e36e38dda4/aapcs64/aapcs64.rst
  https://github.com/ARM-software/abi-aa/releases/download/2022Q1/aapcs64.pdf

In AAPCS64, there are two related but distinct things to be aware of:

* The "stack frame" of a function, which is the entire contiguous region of
  stack memory used by a function.

* The "frame record", which is the saved FP and LR placed *somewhere* within
  the function's stack frame. The FP points at the most recent frame record on
  the stack, and at function call boundaries points at the caller's frame
  record.

AAPCS64 doesn't say *where* a frame record is placed within a stack frame, and
there are reasons for compilers to place above and below it. So in genral, a
functionss stack frame looks like:
      
        +=========+
        |  above  |
        |---------|
        | FP | LR |
        |---------|
        |  below  |
        +=========+

... where the "above" or "below" portions might be any size (even 0 bytes).

Typical code generation today means for most functions that the "below" portion
is 0 bytes in size, but this is not guaranteed, and even today there are cases
where this is not true.

When one function calls another without a stack transition, that looks like:

        +=========+ ___
        |  above  |    \
        |---------|    |
     ,->| FP | LR |    +-- Caller's stack frame

        |---------|    |
        |  below  | ___/
        +=========+

Where there's a stack transition, and the new stack is at a *lower* VA than the
old stack, that looks like:

        +=========+ ___
        |  above  |    \
        |---------|    |

In all of these cases, we *cannot* identify the boundary between the two stack
frames, we can *only* identify where something overlaps a frame record. That
might itself be a good thing, but it's not the same thing as what you describe
in the commit message.

Can you please explain *why* we'd want this?

Who do we expect to use this?

What's the overhead in practice?

Has this passed a more realistic stress test (e.g. running some userspace
applications which make intensive use of copies to/from the kernel)?

As above, we cannot identify this reliably.

On arm64 we always have frame pointers enabled, so this is a confusing comment.
Is this a copy-paste from x86?

As on my prior comment, I don't think we want to alter our generic stack walker
in this way. If we need more info, I'd prefer to expose this in layers, keeping
arch_stack_walk unchanged, but having an arm64_stack_walk that can pass some
arm64-specific data.

What is "flag" ?

That's not what this is skipping. The first time arch_stack_walk() is called,
it gives the PC of its caller (i.e. arch_within_stack_frames), and it's own
synthetic FP. The next time around it gives the FP of it's caller.

This diagram is not valid for arm64. There is no "bp" or "ip", and each stack
frame can be laid out more arbitrarily relative to the frame record.

This check is broken in several ways if there's a stack transition, since the
placement of fp and prev_fp is legitimately arbitrary.

This would also be a lot clearer if you bailed out early rather than nesting
checks.

The best thing you can realistically do is check that the object falls entirely
within a given stack, then check that that no frames intersect the object. You
don't need prev_fp for that, since you can just check each frame record in
turn, then bail out once the object has been passed (i.e. once we've hit the
correct stack, and either seen an FP above it or transitioned to another
stack).

This is the exact same comment as in the header. My comments from there apply
here, and one of the two should disappear.

As above, this *cannot* be selected on arm64.

When do you expect this to happen?

NAK to making a synthetic pt_regs like this. That an abuse of the existing API,
and you don't need to do this in the first place.

A void pointer cast is not necessary.

Thanks,
