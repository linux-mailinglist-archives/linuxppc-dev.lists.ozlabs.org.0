It makes sense to me.Â

I don't get this part... in pseries it looks like virtio devices can be
in device-tree.

Oh, I think I get it... this pci@800000020000000 looks like a bus
(described in device-tree, so discovered), and then the devices are
inside it, getting scanned.

The virtio device gets the correct flags (from pci_parse_of_flags), but
the bus (pci@800000020000000) does not seem to get it correctly,
because it comes from of_bus_pci_get_flags() which makes sense
according to the name of the function.

As seen in the lspci from above comment:
Region 1: Memory at 200080020000 (32-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
Region 4: Memory at 210000010000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=16K]

So it seems to be getting configured properly.

I think the point here is bus resources not getting the MEM_64 flag,
but device resources getting it correctly. Is that supposed to happen?
