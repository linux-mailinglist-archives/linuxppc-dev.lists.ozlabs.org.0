Agree, I think we should try to improve locking scalability of zsmalloc.
I have some thoughts to share, no code or test data yet:

1. First, we can change the pool global lock to per-class lock, which
   is more fine-grained.
2. Actually, we only need to take per-zspage lock when malloc/free,
   only need to take class lock when its fullness changed.
3. If this is not enough, we can have fewer fullness groups, so the
   need to take class lock becomes fewer. (will need some test data)

More comments are welcome. Thanks!
