ISA 2.01 added just a few things (LPES[0], HDEC, some PM things, but
crucially also anything that sets MSR[PR] also sets MSR[EE] since then).

970 is 2.01 -- pretending it is 2.02 is a ticking time bomb: the popcntb
insn will be generated for popcount and parity intrinsics, which can be
generated by generic code!

If that uses -mcpu=power4 (which means ISA 2.01 btw!) all is fine
already?  (Or -mcpu=970, same thing really, it just allows VMX as well).

Thanks for taking care of this Nick, much appreciated!
