That's fine by me. I have a slight preference to drop EXPERT and keep
the ranges in, especially if it affects current distro kernels. Debian
seems to enable EXPERT already in their arm64 kernel config but I'm not
sure about the Fedora or other distro kernels. If they don't, we can
fix/revert this Kconfig entry once the merging window is closed.
