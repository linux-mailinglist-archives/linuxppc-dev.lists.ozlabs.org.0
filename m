I would really like to get the input of the audio maintainers on this.
Sebastian has a good point, especially with us being overworked :-)

Having a shared mem2mem framework would certainly be nice, on the other
hand, developing that will most likely take a substantial amount of time.

Perhaps it is possible to copy the current media v4l2-mem2mem.c and turn
it into an alsa-mem2mem.c? I really do not know enough about the alsa
subsystem to tell if that is possible.

While this driver is a rate converter, not an audio codec, the same
principles would apply to off-line audio codecs as well. And it is true
that we definitely do not want to support audio codecs in the media
subsystem.

Accepting this driver creates a precedent and would open the door for
audio codecs.

I may have been too hasty in saying yes to this, I did not consider
the wider implications for our workload and what it can lead to. I
sincerely apologize to Shengjiu Wang as it is no fun to end up in a
situation like this.

Regards,

	Hans
