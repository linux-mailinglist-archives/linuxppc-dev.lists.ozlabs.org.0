Absolutely makes sense so far.

Well, I was mostly taking about DMA_ATTR_WRITE_COMBINE, which really
should include the NX bit even if pgprot_writecombine doesn't, right?

As you mentioned later we also have the dma_alloc_wc wrapper, and a
single instance of dma_alloc_writecombine.

Exynos looks like purely ARM v7 from Kconfig, so it shouldn't even be
affected.

Oh well.   If we can't make dma_alloc_wc generally safe I fear we'll
have to keep it, but maybe literally limit it to the pre ARM v6
platforms.  While pretty much all callers seems platform specific,
there actually are a decent number that can only work on ARM v7 or
arm64.
