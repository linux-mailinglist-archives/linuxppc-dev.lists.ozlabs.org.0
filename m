 This is what I have also been thinking of.

 After these many years it took from the inception of this change until it 
landed upstream I'm not sure anymore what my original idea was behind 
leaving the link clamped on a retrain failure, but I think it was either 
not to fiddle with the setting beyond the absolute necessity at hand 
(which the scenarios such as Matthew's prove wrong) or to leave the 
setting in a hope that training will eventually have succeeded (but it 
seems to make little sense as there'll be nothing there to actually 
observe the success unless the bus gets rescanned for another reason).

 I'll be at my lab towards the end of the week with a maintenance visit, 
so I'll allocate some time to fiddle with this issue on that occasion and 
implement such an update.
