+
+A new flag for get_user_pages ("gup") has been added: FOLL_PIN. FOLL_PIN h=
as
+significant interactions and interdependencies with FOLL_LONGTERM, so both=
 are
+covered here.
+
+Both FOLL_PIN and FOLL_LONGTERM are "internal" to gup, meaning that neithe=
r
+FOLL_PIN nor FOLL_LONGTERM should not appear at the gup call sites. This a=
llows
+the associated wrapper functions  (pin_user_pages and others) to set the c=
orrect
+combination of these flags, and to check for problems as well.
+
+FOLL_PIN and FOLL_GET are mutually exclusive for a given gup call. However=
,
+multiple threads and call sites are free to pin the same struct pages, via=
 both
+FOLL_PIN and FOLL_GET. It's just the call site that needs to choose one or=
 the
+other, not the struct page(s).
+
+The FOLL_PIN implementation is nearly the same as FOLL_GET, except that FO=
LL_PIN
+uses a different reference counting technique.
+
+FOLL_PIN is a prerequisite to FOLL_LONGTGERM. Another way of saying that i=
s,
+FOLL_LONGTERM is a specific case, more restrictive case of FOLL_PIN.

+Tracking dma-pinned pages
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D
+
+Some of the key design constraints, and solutions, for tracking dma-pinned
+pages:
+
+* An actual reference count, per struct page, is required. This is because
+  multiple processes may pin and unpin a page.
+
+* False positives (reporting that a page is dma-pinned, when in fact it is=
 not)
+  are acceptable, but false negatives are not.
+
+* struct page may not be increased in size for this, and all fields are al=
ready
+  used.
+
+* Given the above, we can overload the page->_refcount field by using, sor=
t of,
+  the upper bits in that field for a dma-pinned count. "Sort of", means th=
at,
+  rather than dividing page->_refcount into bit fields, we simple add a me=
dium-
+  large value (GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS, initially chosen to be 1024: 10 bits=
) to
+  page->_refcount. This provides fuzzy behavior: if a page has get_page() =
called
+  on it 1024 times, then it will appear to have a single dma-pinned count.
+  And again, that's acceptable.
+
+This also leads to limitations: there are only 32-10=3D=3D22 bits availabl=
e for a
+counter that increments 10 bits at a time.
+
+TODO: for 1GB and larger huge pages, this is cutting it close. That's beca=
use
+when pin_user_pages() follows such pages, it increments the head page by "=
1"
+(where "1" used to mean "+1" for get_user_pages(), but now means "+1024" f=
or
+pin_user_pages()) for each tail page. So if you have a 1GB huge page:
+
+* There are 256K (18 bits) worth of 4 KB tail pages.
+* There are 22 bits available to count up via GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS (that =
is,
+  10 bits at a time)
+* There are 22 - 18 =3D=3D 4 bits available to count. Except that there ar=
en't,
+  because you need to allow for a few normal get_page() calls on the head =
page,
+  as well. Fortunately, the approach of using addition, rather than "hard"
+  bitfields, within page->_refcount, allows for sharing these bits gracefu=
lly.
+  But we're still looking at about 16 references.
+
+This, however, is a missing feature more than anything else, because it's =
easily
+solved by addressing an obvious inefficiency in the original get_user_page=
s()
+approach of retrieving pages: stop treating all the pages as if they were
+PAGE_SIZE. Retrieve huge pages as huge pages. The callers need to be aware=
 of
+this, so some work is required. Once that's in place, this limitation most=
ly
+disappears from view, because there will be ample refcounting range availa=
ble.
+
+* Callers must specifically request "dma-pinned tracking of pages". In oth=
er
+  words, just calling get_user_pages() will not suffice; a new set of func=
tions,
+  pin_user_page() and related, must be used.

+FOLL_PIN, FOLL_GET, FOLL_LONGTERM: when to use which flags

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+Thanks to Jan Kara, Vlastimil Babka and several other -mm people, for desc=
ribing
+these categories:
+
+CASE 1: Direct IO (DIO)
+-----------------------
+There are GUP references to pages that are serving
+as DIO buffers. These buffers are needed for a relatively short time (so t=
hey
+are not "long term"). No special synchronization with page_mkclean() or
+munmap() is provided. Therefore, flags to set at the call site are: ::
+
+    FOLL_PIN
+
+...but rather than setting FOLL_PIN directly, call sites should use one of
+the pin_user_pages*() routines that set FOLL_PIN.
+
+CASE 2: RDMA
+------------
+There are GUP references to pages that are serving as DMA
+buffers. These buffers are needed for a long time ("long term"). No specia=
l
+synchronization with page_mkclean() or munmap() is provided. Therefore, fl=
ags
+to set at the call site are: ::
+
+    FOLL_PIN | FOLL_LONGTERM
+
+TODO: There is also a special case when the pages are DAX pages: in additi=
on to
+the above flags, the caller needs something like a layout lease on the
+associated file. This is yet to be implemented. When it is implemented, it=
's
+expected that the lease will be a prerequisite to setting FOLL_LONGTERM.
+
+CASE 3: ODP
+-----------
+(Mellanox/Infiniband On Demand Paging: the hardware supports
+replayable page faulting). There are GUP references to pages serving as DM=
A
+buffers. For ODP, MMU notifiers are used to synchronize with page_mkclean(=
)
+and munmap(). Therefore, normal GUP calls are sufficient, so neither flag
+needs to be set.
+
+CASE 4: Pinning for struct page manipulation only
+-------------------------------------------------
+Here, normal GUP calls are sufficient, so neither flag needs to be set.
+
+page_dma_pinned(): the whole point of pinning
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+The whole point of marking pages as "DMA-pinned" or "gup-pinned" is to be =
able
+to query, "is this page DMA-pinned?" That allows code such as page_mkclean=
()
+(and file system writeback code in general) to make informed decisions abo=
ut
+what to do when a page cannot be unmapped due to such pins.
+
+What to do in those cases is the subject of a years-long series of discuss=
ions
+and debates (see the References at the end of this document). It's a TODO =
item
+here: fill in the details once that's worked out. Meanwhile, it's safe to =
say
+that having this available: ::
+
+        static inline bool page_dma_pinned(struct page *page)
+
+...is a prerequisite to solving the long-running gup+DMA problem.
+
+Another way of thinking about FOLL_GET, FOLL_PIN, and FOLL_LONGTERM
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+Another way of thinking about these flags is as a progression of restricti=
ons:
+FOLL_GET is for struct page manipulation, without affecting the data that =
the
+struct page refers to. FOLL_PIN is a *replacement* for FOLL_GET, and is fo=
r
+short term pins on pages whose data *will* get accessed. As such, FOLL_PIN=
 is
+a "more severe" form of pinning. And finally, FOLL_LONGTERM is an even mor=
e
+restrictive case that has FOLL_PIN as a prerequisite: this is for pages th=
at
+will be pinned longterm, and whose data will be accessed.
+
+Unit testing
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+This file::
+
+ tools/testing/selftests/vm/gup_benchmark.c
+
+has the following new calls to exercise the new pin*() wrapper functions:
+
+* PIN_FAST_BENCHMARK (./gup_benchmark -a)
+* PIN_LONGTERM_BENCHMARK (./gup_benchmark -a)
+* PIN_BENCHMARK (./gup_benchmark -a)
+
+You can monitor how many total dma-pinned pages have been acquired and rel=
eased
+since the system was booted, via two new /proc/vmstat entries: ::
+
+    /proc/vmstat/nr_foll_pin_requested
+    /proc/vmstat/nr_foll_pin_requested
+
+Those are both going to show zero, unless CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is set. This is
+because there is a noticeable performance drop in put_user_page(), when th=
ey
+are activated.
