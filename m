HW is not involved, KVM is not involved anymore and all is emulated at 
the QEMU level in user space. What is the issue ?

That is something else to investigate. feature/capability negotiation
is the core of the hypervisor stack : 

    OPAL <-> PowerNV <-> KVM <-> QEMU <-> guest OS

XIVE is not a kernel capability. It's platform support and the default
for P9 is the native exploitation mode which makes full use of the P9
interrupt controller. For non XIVE aware kernels, the hypervisor emulates
the legacy interface on top of XIVE. 

"xive=off" was introduced for distro testing. It skips the negotiation 
process of the XIVE native exploitation mode on the guest. But it's not
a negotiation setting. It's a chicken switch.

I don't understand. Are you talking about SVM or XIVE ?

OK, but the hypervisor knows if it can handle 'SVM' guests or not and,
if not, there is no point in advertising a 'SVM' capability to the guest.

So you don't have negotiation with the hypervisor ? How does the guest
knows the hypervisor platform can handle SVMs ? try and see if it fails ?
If so, it seems quite broken to me.

Euh. I don't follow. This is indeed where CAS is performed and so it's 
*the* place to check that the hypervisor has 'SVM' support ?

The hypervisor (KVM/QEMU) never knows what are the guest OS capabilities
or its intents. That is why there is a negotiation process. 

I would do :

 * OPAL FW advertises 'SVM' support to the Linux PowerNV (through DT) 
 * KVM advertises 'SVM' support to QEMU (extend KVM ioctls)
 * QEMU advertises 'SVM' support to guest OS (through CAS or DT) 
 * Guest OS should not try to use SVM it is not supported. 

If the passthrough of HW pages is not supported by Ultravisor, KVM 
should not advertised XIVE to QEMU which would then use fallback mode.

If emulated XIVE or XICS is not supported by SVM guests, then we have
a problem and we need to understand why ! :) 

And if XIVE is still a problem, then the guest could change the CAS 
request and remove XIVE when SVM is being set. I suppose that we have 
all this information before CAS. Do we ? 

It should be a runtime choice taking into account the full software 
stack rather than a compile choice at the bottom which would impact
all other options. This is not acceptable IMHO.

Cheers,

C.
