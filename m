After testing I see two problems.

First one is on powerpc e500, increasing CONFIG_LOWMEM_SIZE is not 
enough, CONFIG_LOWMEM_CAM_NUM also need to be increased, otherwise 
additional lowmem is not mapped because e500 linux port is not designed 
to handle additional lowmem with standard pages.

For some details see commit 49e3d8ea6248 ("powerpc/fsl_booke: Enable 
STRICT_KERNEL_RWX")

Second one is with KASAN, as anticipated above in my first response. 
With a 2G+ kernel memory space, the KASAN shadow mem is 256M+, which 
means we get an overlap between lowmem space [0x70000000-0xefffffff] and 
KASAN shadow mem [0xee000000-0xffffffff].
So when KASAN is enabled, either change CONFIG_PAGE_OFFSET and 
CONFIG_TASK_SIZE to 0x60000000 instead of 0x70000000, or reduce 
CONFIG_LOWMEM_SIZE from 0x80000000 to 0x70000000.
