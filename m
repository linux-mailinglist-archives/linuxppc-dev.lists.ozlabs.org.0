There's one wrinkle here: RISC-V started out with 39-bit VAs by default, 
and we've had at least one report of userspace breaking when moving to 
48-bit addresses.  That was just address sanitizer, so maybe nobody 
cares, but we're still pretty early in the transition to 48-bit systems 
(most of the HW is still 39-bit) so it's not clear if that's going to be 
the only bug.

So we're sort of in our own world of backwards compatibility here.  
39-bit vs 48-bit is just an arbitrary number, but "38 bits are enough 
for userspace" doesn't seem as sane a "47 bits are enough for 
userspace".  Maybe the right answer here is to just say the 38-bit 
userspace is broken and that it's a Linux-ism that 64-bit sytems have 
47-bit user addresses by default.
