I am not sure application would want to add that much details/knowledge 
about a platform in their code. I was expecting application to do

#ifdef __ppc64__
         prctl(MAP_SYNC_ENABLE, 1, 0, 0, 0));
#endif
         a = mmap(NULL, PAGE_SIZE, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE,
                         MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE | MAP_SYNC, fd, 0);


For that code all the complexity that we add w.r.t 
ibm,persistent-memory-v2 is not useful. Do you see a value in making all 
these device specific rather than a conditional on  __ppc64__?
