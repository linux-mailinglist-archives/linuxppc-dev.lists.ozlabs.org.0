Good point, I'll fix it in v2.

My aim is to have two variables with and without HAVE_* prefix
for each variant. They already existed for perf:

   + HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF means that it is supported by the arch.
   + HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF means that it will really be built.

1. It will make it clear what variants are available on the give system.
   And it will make it clear what variant is used in the end.

2. It allows to add the dependecy on the global switch HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR.
   It makes it clear that the detector could be disabled by this switch.
   Also it actually allows to use both top-bottom logic and C-like
   definition ordering.

Great catch. Will fix in v2.

This is exactly what I do not want. It would just move the check
somewhere else. But it would make the logic harder to understand.
Especially when the related definitions could not be found by cscope.

Where is this documented, please?
Is it safe to assume this?

I would personally prefer to ensure this by the config check.
It is even better than documentation because nobody reads
documentation ;-)

It took me long time to understand all the dependencies and
possibilities. My motivation is that neither me nor others
would need to absolve the same adventure in the future.

I would prefer to keep it hear to make it clear on the first look.

I'll try and fix in v2.

This is an assumption that only few people knows. I would prefer
to enforce this by the check.

Thanks a lot for the review. I did my best and I got lost many times ;-)
