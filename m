Hello! I have created this patch which allows to disable deprecated
pci-OF-bus-map on powermac and allow to enable this new config option
PPC_PCI_BUS_NUM_DOMAIN_DEPENDENT also on powermac.

So you can test this option too on your powermac boxes.

I'm really not sure if that pci-OF-bus-map is required and for which
platforms or software...

Patch for allowing to disable pci-OF-bus-map is here:
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/patch/20220817163927.24453-1-pali@kernel.org/
