ARMv6+ is where the architecture significantly changed to introduce
the idea of [Normal, Device, Strongly Ordered] where Normal has the
cache attributes.

Before that, we had just "uncached/unbuffered, uncached/buffered,
cached/unbuffered, cached/buffered" modes.

The write buffer (enabled by buffered modes) has no architected
guarantees about how long writes will sit in it, and there is only
the "drain write buffer" instruction to push writes out.

Up to and including ARMv5, we took the easy approach of just using
the "uncached/unbuffered" mode since that is (a) the safest, and (b)
avoids write buffers that alias when there are multiple different
mappings.

We could have used a different approach, making all IO writes contain
a "drain write buffer" instruction, and map DMA memory as "buffered",
but as there were no Linux barriers defined to order memory accesses
to DMA memory (so, for example, ring buffers can be updated in the
correct order) back in those days, using the uncached/unbuffered mode
was the sanest and most reliable solution.

Conventionally, pgprot_writecombine() has only been used to change
the memory type and not the permissions.  Since writecombine memory
is still capable of being executed, I don't see any reason to set XN
for it.

If the user wishes to mmap() using PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, then is there
really a reason for writecombine to set XN overriding the user?

That said, pgprot_writecombine() is mostly used for framebuffers, which
arguably shouldn't be executable anyway - but who'd want to mmap() the
framebuffer with PROT_EXEC?

Looking at the results of grep, I think only OMAP2+ and Exynos may be
affected.

However, removing writecombine support from the DMA API is going to
have a huge impact for framebuffers on earlier ARMs - that's where we
do expect framebuffers to be mapped "uncached/buffered" for performance
reasons and not "uncached/unbuffered".  It's quite literally the
difference between console scrolling being usable and totally unusable.

Given what I've said above, switching to using buffered mode for normal
DMA mappings is data-corrupting risky - as in your filesystem could get
fried.  I don't think we should play fast and loose with people's data
by randomly changing that "because we'd like to", and I don't see that
screwing the console is really an option either.
